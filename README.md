**A Python package for segmenting geospatial data with the Segment Anything Model (SAM)**

## Introduction

The **segment-geospatial** package draws its inspiration from [segment-anything-eo](https://github.com/aliaksandr960/segment-anything-eo) repository authored by [Aliaksandr Hancharenka](https://github.com/aliaksandr960). To facilitate the use of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for geospatial data, I have developed the [segment-anything-py](https://github.com/opengeos/segment-anything) and [segment-geospatial](https://github.com/opengeos/segment-geospatial) Python packages, which are now available on PyPI and conda-forge. My primary objective is to simplify the process of leveraging SAM for geospatial data analysis by enabling users to achieve this with minimal coding effort. I have adapted the source code of segment-geospatial from the [segment-anything-eo](https://github.com/aliaksandr960/segment-anything-eo) repository, and credit for its original version goes to Aliaksandr Hancharenka.

## Features

-   Download map tiles from Tile Map Service (TMS) servers and create GeoTIFF files
-   Segment GeoTIFF files using the Segment Anything Model ([SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything)) and [HQ-SAM](https://github.com/SysCV/sam-hq)
-   Segment remote sensing imagery with text prompts
-   Create foreground and background markers interactively
-   Load existing markers from vector datasets
-   Save segmentation results as common vector formats (GeoPackage, Shapefile, GeoJSON)
-   Save input prompts as GeoJSON files
-   Visualize segmentation results on interactive maps
-   Segment objects from timeseries remote sensing imagery

## Installation

### Install from PyPI

**segment-geospatial** is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/segment-geospatial/). To install **segment-geospatial**, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install segment-geospatial
```

### Install from conda-forge

**segment-geospatial** is also available on [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/segment-geospatial). If you have
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your computer, you can install segment-geospatial using the following commands. It is recommended to create a fresh conda environment for **segment-geospatial**. The following commands will create a new conda environment named `geo` and install **segment-geospatial** and its dependencies:

```bash
conda create -n geo python
conda activate geo
conda install -c conda-forge mamba
mamba install -c conda-forge segment-geospatial
```

If your system has a GPU, but the above commands do not install the GPU version of pytorch, you can force the installation of the GPU version of pytorch using the following command:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge segment-geospatial "pytorch=*=cuda*"
```

Samgeo-geospatial has some optional dependencies that are not included in the default conda environment. To install these dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge groundingdino-py segment-anything-fast
```

## Computing Resources

The Segment Anything Model is computationally intensive, and a powerful GPU is recommended to process large datasets. It is recommended to have a GPU with at least 8 GB of GPU memory. You can utilize the free GPU resources provided by Google Colab. Alternatively, you can apply for [AWS Cloud Credit for Research](https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/research-and-technical-computing/cloud-credit-for-research), which offers cloud credits to support academic research. If you are in the Greater China region, apply for the AWS Cloud Credit [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/events/educate_cloud/research-credits).
