    "[SAM 3D Objects](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam-3d-objects) is a foundation model from Meta that converts masked objects in images into 3D models with pose, shape, texture, and layout. It excels in real-world scenarios with occlusion and clutter.\n",

    "- Linux 64-bit system\n",
    "- NVIDIA GPU with at least 32GB VRAM\n",
    "- HuggingFace authentication for checkpoint access\n",

    "## Tips and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GPU Memory**: SAM 3D requires at least 32GB VRAM. Use smaller images or process objects one at a time if you have memory constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mask Quality**: Better segmentation masks lead to better 3D reconstructions. Use SAM2 or SAM3 for high-quality masks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Object Selection**: SAM 3D works best on:\n",
    "   - Complete, unoccluded objects\n",
    "   - Objects with clear boundaries\n",
    "   - Objects with sufficient texture\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Seed Consistency**: Use the same seed for reproducible results.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Batch Processing**: For multiple objects, use `reconstruct_multiple()` or `reconstruct_from_samgeo()` for efficiency."
